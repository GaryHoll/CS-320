Q. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    A. The code is considered functional if it meets all the functional requirements and runs smoothly. In software testing, we test to make sure the code meets all of the requirements. 
Q. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    A. A user can simply explain thier needs and wants for a program. If a client comes with a project idea, we can simply create a list of user requirements.  
Q. How do I approach designing software?
    A. Designing software can be a challenging task. Start with an idea or a list of requirements and then map it out visually with a tool such as UML. Trying to visualize how each of the parts work with each other makes it easier to grasp the full picture. Following and making sure that the requirments are met and everything works effienctly is also important. The better the design of a piece of software, the faster the coding process will go and the smoother the project as a whole will be.
